# About our model

Our model has 12 features and leverages a radial kernel. The radial kernel was chosen because of the number of features.

- TODO Add and explain nu value
- TODO Add and explain gamma value
- TODO Explain C-Classification vs NU-Classification

# Intial problems with our model.

Initially our model had great a great accuracy rating and a very good ROC AUC value, however it had 1 large problem..

No one. ever. died.

- TODO: insert ROC/ Confusion Matrix for original model

# What was wrong with our model

The crux of the problem with our model is that ~86% of the time, patients survive. When we randomly sampled our data, our minority case would make up a very small portion of the training data set and we could achieve great accuracy with out a model by stating that Patients in ICU never die. 

# Fixing the model

To fix the model we employed a downsampling strategy where we boosted the number of minority cases (death) by sampling a large (95%) of them and then selecting a random but equivalent number of the majority case. This gave us a 50/50 disitribution of out comes

# Results and further tuning

Still not perfect but better! To get the BEST possible model, we employed a grid-search strategy to find the optimal NU and Gamma values. This was a long and lengthy process given the grain at which we wanted to tune the model.

# Challenger model

To verify that a model requiring the number of our features was necessary, we built and similarly tuned another model
with a reduced feature set. In the end, our model with more features performed better than the challenger
